DP - Dynamic Programming
- DP is entirely based on Recursion

Problems with Recursion
- Sub-structure property
- Overlapping sub-problem

When do we use DP ?
- Count something, count number of ways of doing something
- Minimise or Maximise certain values

Fibonacci Series

Ways to Use DP
- Memoization - use recursion with extra array known as cache
 - Top Down Approach
- Tabulation  - without using recursion, it means use loop only
 - Bottom Up Approach


Dice Count
- i/p : target = 7
